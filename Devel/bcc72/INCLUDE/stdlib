/* Ensure that __USING_CNAME__ isn't defined before including the real
   stdlib.h file.  This will cause all the definitions in stdlib.h to be
   brought into the global namespace just as if stdlib.h had been included
   directly.

   Although ANSI C++ rule: 17.4.1.2.7 alludes to the opposite behavior, it
   really only enumerates the cname extensionless headers, and does not
   explicitly describe what should happen when stdlib is included without an
   extension.  So we treat this as though the user really meant to specify
   the .h extension.
